# Change the app icon
  
The quickest way to change the app logo of an iOS app is this:

1. Prepare a 1024x1024px app icon (you’ll need this for the App Store too)
2. Head over to [makeappicon](https://makeappicon.com/) to generate all the app icon sizes needed for the app automatically.
3. __iOS__: Download the __AppIcon.appiconset__ folder and override the existing one at __ios/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset__
4. __Android__: Copy the folders from the downloaded “android” directory and override the subfolders of __android/app/src/main/res__


That’s it. Your AppIcon should look like this in Xcode now:
