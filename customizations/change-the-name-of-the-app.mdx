# Change the name of the app   

### Changing the app name on iOS  

To change the app name on iOS, open the project in __Xcode__, __select the project__ in the left navigation panel, then choose __General__ and modify the __Display Name__ (the first field). Once changed, re-run the project in Xcode, and you’ll notice the app name has changed.

## Changing the app name on Android

To change the name of the Android app, you simply need to open __android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml__ file, and modify the __app_name__ value to the new app name. Now re-run the app, and you’ll notice its name has changed.
