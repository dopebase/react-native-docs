# Change the splash screen logo  

### iOS  

To change the splash screen on iOS, you need to open the native project in Xcode (the __.xcworkspace__ file from the ios/ folder) and locate the __LaunchScreen.xib__ file. You can then drag and drop views, change images & texts, and add constraints into the Interface Builder. Check out this step-by-step tutorial in case you are not familiar with Xcode’s interface builder.

__Note__: The reason why this has been done natively is performance. Any JavaScript library managing the splash screen creates a ton of latency at app start up, which would have been a poor user experience.

### Android  

Similarly, changing the splash screen in Android is done natively to boost startup performance tremendously. To change the splash screen of our React Native templates, locate the __android/app/src/main/res/launch_screen.xml__ and make changes there. You can open the android project in Android Studio, if you want to use the interface builder (drag-and-drop) to make visual changes to the launch screen.
