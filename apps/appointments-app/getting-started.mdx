# Getting Started
  
Thank you for purchasing our React Native Appointments App. This is the official documentation that will help you make use of our source code efficiently and successfully. There are 6 main steps that you need to go through:

1. Build and run the project on iOS and Android
2. Link your own Firebase account & set up push notifications
3. Populate your database with categories & vendors
4. Populate the data for professionals
5. Build and run the professional / appointment management app
6. Make further customizations  

We are going to describe each stage in details, assuming everyone who reads this has no prior React Native experience. If you are already familiar with things such as building React Native iOS projects with Cocoapods, feel free to skip those articles and move on.
