# Getting Started
  
  Thank you for purchasing our [TikTok Clone](https://www.instamobile.io/app-templates/tiktok-clone/). This is the official documentation that will help you make use of our source code efficiently and successfully. There are 5 main stages that you need to go through:

1. Build and run the project on iOS and Android
2. Link your own Firebase account & Push Notifications
3. Deploy the Firebase Functions to your own Firebase
4. Make further customizations  

We are going to describe each stage in details, assuming everyone who reads this has no prior React Native experience. If you are already familiar with things such as building React Native iOS projects with Cocoapods, feel free to skip those articles and move on.

__We recommend you to follow the steps below, in order:__

1. Build and run the downloaded React Native project – [Full Documentation](/docs/getting-started-with-react-native)

2. Link your own Firebase account – [Full Documentation](/docs/firebase-integration)

3. Configure Facebook Login – [Full Documentation](/docs/facebook-login)

4. Configure Push Notifications – [Full Documentation](/docs/push-notifications)

5. Get familiar with our core components and design patterns – [Full Documentation](/docs/core-modules)
