# Hashtags  
When composing a new post with an hashtag, you will need to extract all hashtags from this new post. This is done in the file “__src/screens/NewPostScreen/NewPostScreen.js__” in the method that can be found in __line 55__  with the name “__findHastags__”.  We called this method in __line 72__.  

```mdx 
const onShare = () => {
  setLoading(true);
  const hashtags = findHashtags(newPost.current.postText);
  ```  
  In the method findHashtag, we have used a regular expression to extract hashtags from the caption of a new post. The findHastags method returns and array of hashtags found in the caption of this new post.

We have stored the array of hashtags in __hashtags__ field in the new post object in __line 76__. This new post object also contain fields like “authorID” and “postMedia”.  

```mdx 
authorID: currentUser.id,
hashtags,
postMedia: media,  
```  
Still in __NewPostScreen.js__ file, In __line 94__, you will find “__postAPIManager?.addPost__”.  This method is called with __postToUpload__ object which is an object with the necessary details of the post to upload including fields like __hashtags__. 

```mdx 
};
await postAPIManager?.addPost(
  postToUpload,  
  ```
    The method “__postAPIManager?.addPost__” is defined in the path to the file “__src/Core/socialGraph/feed/api/firebase/post.js__”. Here, in __line 371__,  you will find the definition of the __addPost__ function. In this function, at __line 405__  you will find how each hashtags is saved in the Firebase firestore document.  

    ```mdx
    finalPost.hashtags.forEach((hashtag) => {
  const hashtagRef = firebase
    .firestore()
    .collection('entities')
    .doc('social_feeds_hashtags')
    .collection(hashtag)
    .doc(finalPost.id);
    ``` 

## Reading and displaying hashtags in Discover Screen  

Navigate to path “__src/screens/DiscoverScreen/DiscoverScreen.js__”. Here, you will find the file that displays the discover screen.  We have the discover post at __line 17__ with the name __discoverFeedPosts__. 
 
 ```mdx
 const discoverFeedPosts = useSelector(
  (state) => state.feed.discoverFeedPosts,
);  
```  
At __line 93__,  we have passed this discoverFeedPosts to the method __filterOutRelatedPosts__  that filters out related discover posts.
In this filterOutRelatedPosts method, at __line 59__, we have returned a method with the name __groupByHashTags__ that takes the filteredPosts array.

This groupByHashTags  simply groups the filteredPosts by hashtags and returned an array of grouped hashtags posts in this format:  

```mdx 
{ hashtag: hashtag, videos: [filteredPost] } 

```
