# Push Notifications on Android  

Enabling push notifications on Android is pretty straightforward. All you need to do is replace the __Server Key__ of the __notificationManager__ with your own key. The steps are detailed in [the previous section](/docs/push-notifications/setting-up-push-notifications/). Make sure you re-build and re-run your app after switching to the correct Server Key.
