# Firebase Integration

In this section we will show you how you can update your admin panel to use your own database.

We start by going to the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and to your project, then go to __Project settings__ -> __Service accounts__, and now click Generate new private key. This will generate a new JSON file that contains your private key.

Next you have to do is to go into the admin panelâ€™s folder and go to /db/firebaseDB and remove the .json file and replace it with your own file that you got from the last step.

Lastly you have to __edit index.js__ that is found in the same folder, in db/firebaseDB and change the highlighted lines of code.

Change the first line of code

```mdx 
    const serviceAccount = require("./production-a9404-firebase-adminsdk-nin6u-d632b424d4.json");
``` 

to:

```mdx 
const serviceAccount = require("./Your-Private-Key-File-You-Received.json");
```

And then get your link from where you generated the key and change the second line of code

```mdx
const dbURL = "https://production-a9404.firebaseio.com";
```

to:

```mdx 
const dbURL = "Your-Link";
```

Now you can just start your admin panel, and start editing your own database!
