# Facebook Login on Android  

This section assumes you’ve already set up Firebase Auth with Facebook in [the previous section](/docs/facebook-login/). If you haven’t done that yet, please go back and complete those steps first. To set up Facebook Login in the Android app, follow the next steps, in order.

__1. Generate a Key Hash for your release & debug keystore__  

Follow [Facebook’s documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started/#release-key-hash) to generate a key hash for your debug or/and release keystore. This is used for security purposes.

__2. Place your package name and Key Hash in Facebook__

In [Facebook Developers], go to [Your app] -> [Settings] -> [Basic]. In the Android section, add your package name and the key hash. The package name is the [applicationId], which you set up while configuring Firebase. As a reminder, you can find the [applicationId] in [android/app/build.gradle] file.

__3. Update the FB App ID in the source code__

In the code, open [android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml] file, and replace the facebook_app_id value, with your own Facebook App ID (obtained in [the previous section](/docs/facebook-login/create-a-facebook-app)). Now build and run the app again, and Facebook Login will work with your own app.
