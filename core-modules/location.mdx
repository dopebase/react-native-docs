# Location   

Location, which lives in __src/Core/location__, contains our UI code for dealing with location operations, such choosing a location in an interactive UI. The main component in this module is __IMLocationSelectorModal__.

## IMLocationSelectorModal
This is a UI component that displays a map on the screen and allows the user to interact with it in order to choose a specific location. We use this component in situations like:

+ Adding real estate items (in the real estate app)
+ Checkins in social networks apps
+ Picking the store locations in universal listings app  

To use this component, all you need to do is this:  
```mdx 
<IMLocationSelectorModal
  isVisible={locationSelectorVisible}
  onCancel={onLocationSelectorPress}
  onDone={onLocationSelectorDone}
  onChangeLocation={onChangeLocation}
  appStyles={AppStyles}
/> 
```  
The names of the props should be pretty much self-explanatory. Youâ€™ll notice that the initial coordinate on which the map is focused is a static location. You can specify that location inside the IMLocationSelectorModal file:  

```mdx
const [region, setRegion] = useState({
  latitude: 37.7749,
  longitude: -122.4194,
}); 
```
