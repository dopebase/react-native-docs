# PayPal Payments   

# 1. Deploying Your Payments Server  

In order to setup Paypal, you’ll need your own Payments server. To test the payments in your app, you can deploy this server on your local machine.

However, when you are planning to release the app to the App Store or Google Play Store, you’ll need to deploy the server publicly, in production. You can either deploy it to Firebase or Heroku, or any other hosting service that supports Node.js (e.g. Digital Ocean, AWS, etc).

__Action Required__

Prior to testing you PayPal integration you have to register for sandbox Braintree at https://sandbox.braintreegateway.com/login and get your necessary credentials by clicking on the gear icon at the top right of your profile then click API.

__1. Create a folder and navigate into the folder via the command line:__  

```mdx 
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
```  

__2. Initialise the project and press enter for every prompt and then yes for the final question:__  

```mdx 
npm init  
```  
__3. Install the following dependencies:__

```  
## Deploying to Firebase  

For deploying to firebase you need to have gotten your production credentials at https://apply.braintreegateway.com/ then proceed to 

1. Configure Firebase functions

Run the following command to install Firebase functions globally on your machine 

```mdx  
npm install -g firebase-tools  
```   
then log into your firebase on your machine by running   

```mdx  
firebase login
```  
2. Create your Firebase function

Create a folder to contain your Firebase functions project and then run the command to setup your folder structure  

```mdx 
firebase init functions  
```  
Please ensure that you click on the <span style={{color: 'red' }}> Create a new Project</span> option then enter your preferred <span style={{color: 'red' }}>unique project id</span> and use your preferred project name. You also have to choose Javascript as your choice of language to write with and select the option to install dependencies.

3. The final step is to deploy your firebase  

```mdx 
npm run deploy
```  
And your backend should be live and you will get a URL to your new functions.
