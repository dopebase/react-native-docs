# In-App Purchases  
  
We have managed In-App purchases for iOS and Android with “react-native-iap” library. This library enables us to manage In-App purchases smoothly for both Android and iOS.

## Configuring IAPs For iOS on App Store Connect.
To accept auto-renew subscriptions in ur app first, you have to log in to App Store Connect  -> __Agreements, Tax and Banking__  

![](/../static/img/1_i4TrleXTX-n-VzrVeLgTlQ.png)  

Then accept all the Paid Apps Agreements and you will see something like this:  

![](/../static/img/1_mUCqCuMdxrPItyLbKv8LPw.png)  

If the agreements have not been accepted you can’t see the option to create the __AutoRenew__ subscription.

__Create the subscriptions__

 + Within App Store Connect, click __Apps__, followed by the App you wish to add in-app purchases to.
 + You should find __In-App Purchases__ at the left side of your page, amongst the tabs.
 + Under __In-App Purchases__, click __Manage__.
Here, we can add subscriptions as well as a “billing grace period” feature that postpones ending a subscription until a certain period of time passes after a subscription expires.

Click the __+++ icon next to your __In-App Purchases__ subheading to add an IAP, and follow the two-step process of choosing its type, followed by its name and reference number:

 Your __Reference Name__ should be a readable and easily recognizable label for the subscription item, whereas the __Product ID__ needs to be a unique identifier for the item.

If you host many apps, using the com.org.app.iapId may be a more manageable Product ID convention, ensuring that there are no overlapping values between apps.

From here you can jump into each of your purchase items and configure a range of metadata — here are some of the more interesting features you can configure:

+ Subscription pricing, with a toggle to automatically generate prices for every supported currency. This is extremely useful for displaying prices in-app.
+ Promotional offers and introductory offers to spur new customers. Specific start and end dates can be set (or even no end date for an ongoing promotion), as well as a specific payment type.
  
  Be sure to check out all the options available for your In-App Purchase item to further tailor your offer.

Later on, we will fetch the configured IAPs further down and use in our project.

__Create a sandbox test user__

+ Still in App Store Connect  -> __My Apps__ -> __Users and Access__.
+ On the __Users and Access__ page, you should find __Sanbox__ on the left tab.

+ create a Tester account that will later be used to test IAPs on your app. 

## Configuring IAPs for Android on Google Play Console

1. As described in the above screenshot, you need to __upload an APK__ and __set up a merchant account__ before creating an In-app product.
2. If you’ve done it, you can create a managed product or subscribe products as shown in below screenshot.

## Flow Overview   

+ Using ‘__react-native-iap__”  library, we fetch subscription details with the previously configured subscription __SKUs__ for different platforms.
+ We display on the screen, the localized price and title of the subscription detail.
+ The user selects a subscription plan and completes a purchase.
+ The Subscription plan is immediately active and auto-renewable.
+ To cancel a plan, The user will have to go to the phone App settings and log in to the services provider
+ Select subscriptions and find the list of subscriptions available. 

### Codebase  

All the code related to In-App purchases lives in __src/Core/inAppPurchase__. Among the most important classes, we can list:

+ __IMSubScriptionScreen__
     + This is a component for display.
     + Here, we have the UI for the subscription screen.
     + It also starts a subscription purchase when we press the Purchase button in the UI.
+ __IAPManagerWrapped__
     + This returns a context that wraps the main App.
     + It also manages the logic for completing a purchase.
     + It manages the logic for checking and getting a subscription plan a device.
     + It also loads active subscription plan from the Firebase Firestore in case we have an active subscription but we are logged in on a different device with no subscription plan.
     + It also validates IOS transaction receipts.  

___Validating IOS Transaction Receipts__. To validate a transaction receipt on IOS, you will need to generate an ___App-Specific Shared Secret__

In the Features screen of [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/login) app, we can see a link

__App-Specific Shared Secret__

Click on it and generate a new App Secret. This app secret is necessary to validate a transaction receipt.

enter the generated shared secret in __src/DatingConfig.js__  
```mdx 
IAP_SHARED_SECRET: 'enter_shared_secret_here',
```
