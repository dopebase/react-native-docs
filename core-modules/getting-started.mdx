# Getting Started

All of our React Native codebases are making use of a subset of Core Modules, which the strategy we use to make our code of high-quality and highly modularized. These are submodules that are implementing specific parts of a mobile app, and that are independent and reusable between each other. The all live in __src/core__, and can be modified and customized by you as needed.
