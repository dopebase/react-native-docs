# Camera  

Camera, a module which lives in Core/camera, is our subsystem that allows taking photos and videos with the full screen camera. __IMCameraModal__ is the most important component, which can be used as follows:  
```mdx
<IMCameraModal
  isCameraOpen={isCameraOpen}
  onImagePost={onImagePost}
  onCameraClose={onCameraClose}
/>  
```  
This component handles a few complex tasks, such as:

+ switching between front (IMPreCamera.js) and back camera (IMPostCamera.js)
+ taking pictures
+ recording videos
+ importing photos and videos from the library  

It sends back the asset source via __onImagePost_ callback. Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of handling the response of camera selection:  

```mdx 
onPostStory = async source => {
 // use source.uri to handle the asset on device (photo / video)
}
```  
Under the hood, it relies on [expo-camera](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/camera/) package.
