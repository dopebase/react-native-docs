# Enable Firebase Auth  

To enable Firebase Auth, simply go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) -> __Authentication__ -> __Sign-in Methods__ and enable the methods that you are going to support in your app. By default, our React Native apps have integration with __Email/Password__, __Phone__ and __Facebook__.

  For Facebook Login, youâ€™ll also need your Facebook App ID. You can add that later when you [set up Facebook](/docs/facebook-login/).
