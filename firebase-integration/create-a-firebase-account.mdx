# Create a Firebase Account  

First of all, letâ€™s start by creating your own Firebase account. Head over to [Firebase.com](https://firebase.google.com/) and create an account. Once you have created an account, you get access to your own [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). A Firebase account can host multiple Firebase Projects that can host multiple mobile apps.
