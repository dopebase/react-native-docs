# Enable Apple Pay on iOS  

To enable Apple Pay, you need to create an Apple Merchant ID first, on Appleâ€™s [Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/). Once you have a Merchant ID, you can download a certificate generated by Apple and upload it to your Stripe dashboard. Follow these [detailed instructions](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay) to enable Apple Pay with Stripe.

Once you have uploaded the Apple Pay certificate to Stripe, go to __src/ShopertinoConfig__ and update the __MERCHANT_ID__ value with your own Apple Merchant ID.  

```mdx 
STRIPE_CONFIG: {
  PUBLISHABLE_KEY: 'pk_test_LSo5mTIQqkRiTWd0eBMSDAdsdt3', // "pk_test_..." in test mode and ""pk_live_..."" in live mode
  MERCHANT_ID: 'Your_merchant_id_goes_here',
  ANDROID_PAYMENT_MODE: 'test', // test || production
},  
```
