# Stripe Tutorial

## Integrating Stripe Payment Module from One React Native App to Another

This tutorial outlines the steps to integrate the Stripe payment module from an existing React Native app into another app.

## Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

Make sure you have the necessary Stripe dependencies installed in your target app. Run the following command:
  
  ```mdx
  npm install @stripe/stripe-react-native
  ```  

  Step 2: Copy Payment Logic  

1. __Copy Payment API__: 
   – Copy the payment processing logic from `src/Core/payments/api/paymentProcessor/paymentRequestClient.js` to your target app. This includes functions like `chargeStripeCustomer`, `setupStripe`, etc.

2. __Copy Hooks__: 

   – Copy the `usePaymentRequest` and `usePaymentSheetManager` hooks from `src/Core/payments/usePaymentRequest.js` and `src/Core/payments/usePaymentSheetManager.js` respectively.

3. __Copy Redux Actions__: 

   – If your payment module uses Redux, copy the relevant actions and reducers from `src/Core/payments/redux/checkout.js` to your target app.

## Step 3: Update Configuration

1. __Stripe Configuration__: 

   – Ensure that your target app has the necessary Stripe configuration. This includes the publishable key and any other required settings. Set this up in your app’s configuration file.

2. __Google Services__: 

   – If your app uses Firebase, ensure that the `googleServicesFile` is correctly set up in your `app.json` or `AndroidManifest.xml`.

## Step 4: Implement Payment Logic

1. __Create Payment Form__: 

   – In your target app, create a payment form component where users can enter their payment details. Use the `StripeProvider` to wrap your app or the specific component where you handle payments.

 ```mdx

   import React from ‘react’;

   import { StripeProvider } from ‘@stripe/stripe-react-native’;

   import App from ‘./App’; // Your main app component

   const AppWrapper = () => {

     return (

       <StripeProvider

         publishableKey=”your-publishable-key”

         merchantIdentifier=”merchant.identifier” // Optional

       >

         <App />

       </StripeProvider>

     );

   };

   export default AppWrapper;

   ```

2. __Use Payment Hooks__: 

   – Use the `usePaymentRequest` and `usePaymentSheetManager` hooks in your payment form component to handle payment requests and manage the payment sheet.

  ```mdx

   import React, { useState } from ‘react’;

   import { Button, View } from ‘react-native’;

   import usePaymentRequest from ‘./path/to/usePaymentRequest’;

   const PaymentForm = () => {

     const appConfig = {}; // Your app configuration

     const { chargeStripeCustomer, setupStripe } = usePaymentRequest(appConfig);

     const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

     const handlePayment = async () => {

       setLoading(true);

       const email = ‘customer@example.com’; // Get this from your form

       const setupResponse = await setupStripe(email);

       

       if (setupResponse.success) {

         const chargeResponse = await chargeStripeCustomer({

           amount: 1000, // Amount in cents

           currency: ‘usd’,

           token: setupResponse.data.token, // Get token from your form

         });

         // Handle charge response

       }

       setLoading(false);

     };

     return (

       <View>

         <Button title=”Pay” onPress={handlePayment} disabled={loading} />

       </View>

     );

   };

   export default PaymentForm;

   ```

## Step 5: Test the Integration

1. __Run Your App__: 

   – Start your target app and navigate to the payment form.

2. __Test Payments__: 

   – Use test card numbers provided by Stripe to test the payment flow.

## Step 6: Handle Errors and Edge Cases

Make sure to handle errors gracefully, such as network issues or payment failures. Use alerts or notifications to inform users of any issues.
