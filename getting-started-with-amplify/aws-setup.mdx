# AWS Setup 

## Introduction

<Admonition type="info" title="Overview" icon="💡">
Here we will show you how to integrate your React Native project with a back-end using AWS Amplify.

##### What is included in your AWS Amplify Project:

- User authentication (AWS Cognito).
- GraphQL API (AppSync)
- Lambda function and Lambda Trigger function
- Storage using Amazon S3. 
</Admonition>


## Setup

To get started with AWS Amplify in your React Native project, you'll need to install and configure the Amplify CLI by clicking [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen1/react-native/start/getting-started/installation/) to find out exactly how to do that.

## Configuration:

### Initialise the AWS Amplify project

From command line at the root of your project run: 
`amplify init`  

You will be asked:

+ Enter a name for the environment (dev)
+ Choose your default editor
+ Select the authentication method you want to use with two options: AWS profile ,  AWS access keys.
+ Select AWS profile and select the profile you will like to use.  

This is what it would look like:

After doing this, you will be done with initialising ur project.

To see your resources available to push, run: 
`amplify status`  
run the command bellow to push auth
`amplify push auth`
run the command bellow to push api
`amplify push api`   

This is what it would look like:

![](/../static/img/Screen-Shot-2024-11-05-at-1.37.57-PM.png) 


Now to push the functions, you need to:
- Configure a new server app client for your function
- Add environment variables for your functions.
- Register a user in your react native app to access app client in your functions
- Delete created account in dynamoDB 


### Configure a server app client for your function

1. **Log in to your AWS Amplify account**.
2. Click on the **search input**, and enter **Cognito**. Click on **Cognito** under **Services**.
3. Copy the **User pool ID** and paste it somewhere (you will need it later).

4. After copying the pool id, click on the **App clients** section.
5. Click on **Add another app client**.

![App Clients Screenshot](/../static/img/annotely_image_9.jpeg)

7. Give it any name you want.
8. Set your **Auth Flows Configuration** like in the image below:

![App Clients Screenshot](/../static/img/annotely_image_7.jpeg)

9. After saving, you will have your **App client id**. Copy it and paste it somewhere.

Now you have the **Pool id** (Cognito user pool id) and **App client id** saved.

### Add environment variables for your functions

You will need to update the environment variables for the two **Lambda functions**. To do this, run the command:

```bash
amplify update function
```
Select any of the functions, then select **Environment variables configuration**. Configure each environment variable with the names and values as written above.

- **COGNITO_CLIENT_ID**: `<app-client-id>`
- **COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID**: `<pool-id>`
- **ADMIN_USER_USERNAME**: `<chosen-username>`
- **ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD**: `<chosen-password>` (password must be a minimum of 8 characters with numbers)

The process should look like: 

![Environment Configuration Screenshot](/../static/img/annotely_image_10.jpeg)

Also navigate to the `src` directory in the two functions and run
 ```bash 
 cd amplify/backend/function/instamobileFunction/src 
 npm install
 ```  
### Repeat the process for the second function.

Remember you need to repeat this process for the second function (`instamobileTrigger`). And this is all. you can now push your functions by running the command:
```bash
amplify push function
```


### Register a user in your react native app to access app client in your functions 

You need to do this in order to give your functions access to app sync using access token from ur created app client.
Now go to your react native app and register a new user with your chosen **username(email)** and **chosen password** you added as environment variables

### Delete created account from dynamoDB  

Now search for dynamoDb in the search input on your account on the web 

![](/../static/img/Screenshot-2022-05-20-at-2.54.58-PM-1024x350.png)  

– Click on __DynamoDB__ under services
– Select __Tables__ section at the left, then __explore items__
– Select user and delete the newly created user from ur __dynamoDb__ so it is not accessible to other users.

Your app is ready to use.


<Admonition type="success" title="Ready to Build!" icon="🚀">
Your Amplify CLI is now configured and ready to use. You can start building your AWS-powered applications with full access to AWS services through Amplify.

If you're facing problems with your storage. You can remove and add it again by running commands.

```bash
amplify remove storage
amplify push storage
amplify add storage
amplify push storage
```

<!-- 
## Configure a server app client for your function
login to your amplify account
click on the __search input__, and enter __cognito__ and cick on __cognito__ under __services__ 
click on __Manage User Pools__ and select your already created userpool  

![](/../static/img/Screenshot-2022-03-22-at-9.50.59-AM-1024x372.png) 

Copy the __pool id__ and paste it some where. (you will need it later)
After copying the pool id, click on __App clients__ section
You need to __add another app client__. So click on that.  

![](/../static/img/Screenshot-2022-03-22-at-9.54.19-AM-1024x449.png)  

Give it which ever name you want.
Set your __Auth Flows Configuration__ like in the image below: 

![](/../static/img/Screenshot-2022-05-20-at-10.55.37-AM-1024x523.png)  

After saving, you will have your __App client id__. You should also copy that and paste it somewhere.

Now we have the __Pool id__ (cognito user pool id) and __App client id__ copied and pasted somewhere.

## Add environment variables for your functions

You will need to update the environment variables for the two __lamda functions__.
The variable names and values.
The values will be what you previously copied and saved. The __app client id__, __pool id__ and the rest.
(note your choosen __username(email)__ and __password__.)
(password must be a minimum of 8 characters with numbers)
 
 – COGNITO_CLIENT_ID: `<app-client-id>`

– COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID: `<pool-id>`

– ADMIN_USER_USERNAME: `<chosen-username>`

– ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD: `<chosen-password>` 
 
 To do this, run the command

`amplify update function`

select any of the functions
then select __Environment variables configuration__
Then configure for each environment variable, the names and values as written above

## Remember you need to repeat this process for the second function. 

And this is all. you can now push your functions by running the command:
amplify push function

Your app is ready to use. -->

<!-- ## Register a user in your react native app to access app client in your functions 

You need to do this in order to give your functions access to app sync using access token from ur created app client.
Now go to your react native app and register a new user with ur __chosen username(email)__ and __chosen password__ you added as environment variables

## delete created account from dynamoDB  

Now search for dynamoDb in the search input on your account on the web
